Your ROMs must be zipped and placed in the ROMs folder of FBA.

Once that is done, load FBA and load game. A red strikethrough icon means the game cannot be played. If you try to load a game which cannot be played, it will tell you which ROMs you need. Be warned that there are some ROMs that require extra files other than those found in MAME (the Neo-Geo BIOS is a good example).

You will have to find the ROMs and BIOSes by yourself.
